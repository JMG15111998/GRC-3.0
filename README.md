## üìå Introduction

This README documents a cybersecurity maturity assessment based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. The goal is to evaluate the current security posture of the organization and build a roadmap toward Tier 4: Adaptive maturity. All evaluations consider HIPAA compliance and the protection of ePHI (electronic Protected Health Information).

## üìâ Current Profile Overview (Tier 1‚Äì2)

### üîª Summary of Key Weaknesses

- ‚ùå No Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or secure access control policies
- ‚ùå No PHI classification or asset inventory in place
- ‚ùå No SIEM, log monitoring, or alerting thresholds configured
- ‚ùå No Incident Response (IR) Plan, breach workflow, or BCP testing
- ‚ùå No defined governance structure or cybersecurity leadership
